# Feedhook (1.0.0)
This mod adds a new /suggestion command that sends this suggestion directly to discord with a webhook

# Features
- Send In-Game suggestions from players to discord with a webhook
- A 300 second cooldown is integrated between each use of the command to avoid unwanted spam from players
- Message sanitization to prevent mention abuse like @everyone or @here on discord

# Commands
`/suggestion <message>`: Send a suggestion message in a discord room defined with the webhook
Players without `shout` privs won't be able to execute the command

Example: `/suggestion Add a new sprint mod to the server, the one that we have is full of bugs!`

# Configuration
You can customize the message validation rules by modifying the value in the settings:
`maximum_characters`: Maximum length per suggestion (500) -- Helps avoid massive messages spam
`minimum_characters`: Minimum message per suggestion (25) -- Helps avoid small/unnecessary messages

2. Add `feedhook` to your `secure.http_mods` setting (conf)
3. Install aiohttp: `sudo apt install aiohttp`
